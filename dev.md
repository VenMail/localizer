# Development Guide – Localizer

This document is for contributors and maintainers working on the
`Localizer – AI i18n for React, Vue & Laravel` VS Code extension.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm
- VS Code (or a VS Code–compatible IDE) for debugging the extension

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone and install dependencies**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd vscode-ai-assistant
   npm install
   ```

2. **Compile the extension**

   ```bash
   # One-off build
   npm run compile

   # Or watch mode during development
   npm run watch
   ```

---

## Running the Extension in VS Code

1. Open the `vscode-ai-assistant` folder in VS Code.
2. Run **Debug: Start Debugging** (or press `F5`).
3. A new **Extension Development Host** window will open with the extension loaded.
4. In that window:
   - Open a test React, Vue, or Laravel project.
   - Use the **AI i18n** commands from the Command Palette.
   - Use hover / go-to-definition / completion on translation keys.
5. Use the Debug Console in the main VS Code window to inspect logs.

---

## Building a VSIX Package

You can build a `.vsix` package for installing the extension into
VS Code or AI-first IDEs that support VS Code extensions (e.g. Windsurf, Cursor).

From the `vscode-ai-assistant` directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
npm run package
```

This generates a file like `ai-assistant-0.0.1.vsix` in the project root.

### Installing the VSIX

In any VS Code–compatible editor:

1. Open the Command Palette.
2. Run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**.
3. Select the generated `ai-assistant-0.0.1.vsix` file.
4. Reload the window when prompted.

---

## Updating the Extension Version

When you are preparing a new release:

1. Increment the `version` field in `package.json`.
2. Rebuild and package:

   ```bash
   npm run compile
   npm run package
   ```

3. Install the new `.vsix` in your target environment and verify:
   - Extension activates without errors.
   - i18n commands and IntelliSense behave as expected.

---

## Project Structure (High Level)

- `src/` – TypeScript sources for the extension runtime
  - `core/` – core services (indexing, workspace utilities, text validation, etc.)
  - `providers/` – IntelliSense providers (hover, definition, completion)
  - `commands/` – command implementations (configure project, apply translations, scripts)
  - `services/` – helper services (OpenAI translation, project config, file system)
- `src/i18n/` – Node.js helper scripts and shared JS utilities for extraction/rewrites
- `out/` – compiled JavaScript (generated by `npm run compile`)

---

## Coding Notes

- Follow the existing TypeScript style and lint rules (`npm run lint`).
- Avoid silent failures: log errors and surface meaningful messages in VS Code.
- Keep user-facing behavior framework-aware (React, Vue, Laravel) and driven by
  configuration and the i18n index, rather than hard-coded paths.
